\section{Discussion}
Although, as shown in the last chapter, the case when only the gate execution time is optimized yielded the best result, both the case when gate execution cost is optimized and both costs are optimized reached to the most optimal qubit allocation, which are (1,3) and (0, 2, 4, 5).  The difference between the total execution times between two cases happened due to the nature of parallel execution in my simulator, which is that each gate is executed in not rigorously sequential order and  the delay of communication  between two threads, which emulate quantum processors.
