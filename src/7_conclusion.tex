\section{Conclusion}
This work formulated the qubit allocation problem for distributed quantum computing as an optimization problem, and proposed its objective function.  Also, it demonstrated that the optimized quantum allocation by the proposed allocation technique achieved the reduction of the total execution time, at least with the comparison with the case of random allocation.  More larger-scale and sophisticated experiments have to be performed in order to validate the efficiency of the proposed allocation techniques over other allocation techniques which only focus on either gate execution cost and communication cost, shown in the evaluation chapter.
