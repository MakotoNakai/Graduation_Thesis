\section{Conclusion}
This work formulated the qubit allocation problem for distributed quantum computing as an optimization problem, and proposed its objective function.  Also, it demonstrated that the optimized quantum allocation by the proposed allocation technique achieved the reduction of the total execution time in a distributed quantum computing.
