\section{Background}
\label{introduction:background}
 Quantum computers are theoretically capable of solving some intractable problems for classical computers including the factoring problem and the digital quantum simulations in a polynomial time, and large-scale quantum computing is the key to perform computation that even a supercomputer cannot handle.   Two approaches for large-scale quantum computing have been proposed. One is to build a single large quantum processor, and the other is to perform quantum computing over more than one quantum processors that are connected via communication links.  The later approach is considered as more practical because it requires less number of qubits and error rate, which are the two most challenging aspects of building a hardware for large-scale quantum processor.
 
 However, unlike the previous works about the system for quantum computing on a single quantum processor,  only few works have investigated the procedure to perform distributed quantum computing in the real world, especially how to convert an user program which includes the quantum circuit to the executable form onto distributed quantum computers.

\section{Research Contribution}
\label{introduction:research_contribution}
The main contribution of this project is the heuristic optimization algorithm for qubit allocation problem for distributed quantum computing, which determines which qubits and associated quantum gates will be executed on which quantum processor.  This work adopts the total execution time as the optimization criteria, because the algorithm for qubit allocation with emphasis on total fidelity of the output quantum state can be solved by the existing quantum compilation techniques.
