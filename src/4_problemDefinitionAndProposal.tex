\section{Problem Definition}
Create the base for traffic testing to make the Quantum Internet practical. 
Traffic tests in the Quantum Internet have yet to be devised. 
In this paper, I propose a definition of traffic in the Quantum Internet and a method to generate traffic data for traffic tests and show the base of traffic tests for the Quantum Internet.

\section{Proposal}
First, the traffic in the Quantum Internet should be defined. 
Traffic in the Quantum Internet is defined as one connection to one traffic. 
In other words, it does not matter how many bell pairs are shared in a single connection, or how long the connection takes.
In the Quantum Internet, when a node wants to start a connection with another node, it sends a setup request to that node.
Therefore, the number of setup requests sent by a node is the egress traffic, and the number of setup requests received by a node is the ingress traffic.

The generation of the traffic matrix for the Quantum Internet is done using the gravity model. 
This is identical to the method traffic is generated on the current Internet. 
The method of the current Internet will be applied to the Quantum Internet.
For the gravity model type, the simplest SimpleGravityModel is used.
The reason for this is that this is the first attempt to apply the gravity model to Quantum Internet traffic generation, and in addition, the gravity model itself can be made more complex at will later.
The equation for Simple Gravity Model\cite{zhang2003fast}\cite{trafficmatrix_presentation}, which represents the total amount of traffic going from point j to point i, is as follows.
\begin{screen}
    \begin{dfn}[Simple Gravity Model]
        \begin{equation}
            T(i,j) = \frac{T_{ingress}(i)*T_{egress}(j)}{T_{total}}
        \end{equation}
    \end{dfn}
    $T(i,j)$ means the amount of traffic from point j to point i. 
    $T_{ingress}(i)$ is ingress traffic at point i.
    $T_{egress}(j)$ is egress traffic at point j.
    $T_{total}$ is the amount of overall traffic movement in the network.
\end{screen}
The same equation for generating the traffic matrix is applied to the Quantum Internet. 
For that, need to clarify the definition of ingress traffic and egress traffic in Quantum Internet.
The definitions of ingress traffic and egress traffic are described above. 
Ingress traffic is the number of connection setup requests received by a node.
